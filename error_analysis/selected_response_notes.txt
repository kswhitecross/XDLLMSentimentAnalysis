1630: Even though post does not have a body, and the title is not informative about what the 
post is actually about, LLM uses comments to conclude that the post has to do with users being 
worried about Valve/Steam going offline and them therefore losing their games. Model concludes just
from the comments alone that users can be reassured that even if Steam goes offline, they'll have
access to their games. But in reality the meme in the reddit post is implying that a new announcement 
from Steam saying that gamers don't own their games will push gamers to pirate games instead. This isn't 
necessarily the LLM's fault because it doesn't have any idea of what the meme caption is in the reddit post

Score: 1.8

430: LLM uses title of document to infer that today is election day in the US. Model correctly
assesses the comments of the post as being mixed and picks out specific examples such as when 
someone said that it was a bad day to stop drinking for them. However, model says that the comments
are talking about specific candidates, when that is not the case for the inquiry document.

Score: 2.5

2198: LLM correctly assesses that comments are talking about how there's many fields of science that
humans have never discovered as the post title is "There are likely entire fields of science yet to be discovered that
 we are currently completely blind to.". However, LLM formats output in a weird way by asking itself numerous questions
in the form of "**What is the main takeaway from the NEW content chunk about <X>**" where X is a certain topic of 
interest

Score: 1.5

2045: LLM outputs takeaways in clean numbered format (1. 2. etc.). LLM correctly summarizes what thoughts 
people have about time travel and the hypothetical scenarios that would play out if time travel existed, for example, people
going back in time to tell the founding fathers to make sure to give Supreme Court judges term limits

Score: 2.8

2049: LLM correctly knows that original post title is talking about how it would be unrealistic for there to 
be no teen pregnancies at Hogwarts given they didn't have sex ed class. LLM also picks out a specific comment about 
the "Fetus Deletus" spell and says that comment is humourous and light hearted.

796: Model correctly knows post is talking about Ukraine invading Russia in response to Russia's intitial invation. However,
LLM incorrectly says that the situation is being viewed with a mix of emotions, even though comments tend to heavily be in favor
of Ukraine pushing into Russian territory to get back at Putin. Model also says that Russian forces massacred innocent people during
the Beslan school siege, which is incorrect. Even though hundreds did die during the siege, it was not Russian forces themselves that
were responsible for the deaths of those at the school. It is true that Russian forces were partially responsible for the deaths of
those in the siege, but to say they "massacred" hundreds of innocent civilians is false.

Score: 1.6

355: Model incorrectly says that post is talking about a variety of topics when this is incorrect: The post is asking users what behaviors
others might exhibit that others do not when addicted to porn, or when they watch too much porn. Model says that people are talking about poltiics, 
Elon Musk, etc., when this is incorrect. Only one of the points returned by the model discusses the topic of pornography at all. This hallucination
might be because the in context domain is World News.

Score: 1.2

2134: Model correctly identifies that reddit post is about how you technically recycle your own farts by smelling them. Model correctly assesses that

own farts as to not put the methane into the atmosphere

1725: LLM is sort of correct in identifying the topic of discussion: The meme image is joking that when people get to work they're happy but after only 10 minutes
of their shirt they start to dislike human beings. Model only uses comments to assess that the general topic is still workers and how they become stressed out at 
work a lot, especially when interacting with customers

Score: 2.7

713: LLM correctly identifies that the topic is discussion is the unsealing of a document which claims that over 2800 influencers have been associated with
Russian propaganda as a part of a larger Russian disinfo scheme. Model correctly identifies that comments are negative and express a mix of emotions such as outrage
and anticipation. Model also includes what topics the user is interested based on in context documents, althought there is nothing in the prompt
which tells the LLM to tell the user what themes or interests they have shown interest in via the in context documents

Score: 2.5

1617: Model correctly identifies the topic of discussion being the semi-retirement of a YouTuber, in this case PewDiePie. The original meme references how he 
is now just the 10th most subscribed channel on YouTube. Model identifies that PewDiePie is now focusing on other aspects of life instead of just YouTube, such
as family. The only negative of the LLM's response is that it does not explicity recognize that PewDiePie is the youtuber of question, but that's not its fault
considering he is mentioned nowhere in the comments or post title

Score: 2.9

611: LLM correctly identifies tthe topic of discussion as the discontinuation of the mobile game "The Simpsons: Tapped Out". Model correctly identifies the tone of
the comments as reminiscing, but the entire response is in the second person: For example, the model says: "The game was a way for you to connect with your father during 
a difficult time in your family, as your parents were going through a divorce." as if the user is writing the comments on the reddit post, not third parties. Nonetheless,
model still gets the themes of the responses correct

Score: 2.5

1811: Model correctly identifies topic of discussion to be the recent death of actor Donald Sutherlnd at the age of 88. Model correctly identifies that comments praise his

Model makes a great obersavation by saying that the comments worry about Trump becoming more "authoritatian" even though the phrase authoritarian is seen nowhere in the comments. 
Model also observes that European commenters are concerned about dependencies on the US, while saying the EU may need to look elsewhere for trading partners.

388: Model correctly identifies that users are talking about what activities most often lead to sex. Model gives a good summary of comments, saying that users think that
activities such as rubbing legs together, drinking, and nighttime pool parties lead to sex most often. One commenter also mentioned that cudding produces boners and then the
urge to put that boner somewhere leads to sex, although model just says that the commenter said that cudding itself leads to sex, which is true, but doesn't include the full 
context of the comment by leaving out the term boner

2156: Model correctly identifies that reddit post is about how gamers have geographical knowledge of places that don't exist. Model correctly identifies that gamers can have 
extremely detailed knowledge about virtual geographic environments even though it's a useless skill. However, model fails to extract example comments of some places that gamers
tend to have good geographic knowlege, such as Liberty City and Los Santos from GTA 4 and 5 respectively

3898: Model correctly identifies that reddit post is about Spain's plans to enshrine gay marriage and abortion rights in their constitution. One minor error about response is 
that model incorrectly identifies the reddit comments as "the author" instead of a group of commenters. Model infers that commenters are talking about how the change would signal
to international community that Spain is committed to human rights, but no comment specifically says anything about the rest of the worlds perspective on the change

"The author is likely a fan of the TV show "Narcos" or has a strong opinion about it" but then also says "The author is not necessarily a fan of J.D. or the TV show "Narcos". which
