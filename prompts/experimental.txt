Here are the last few documents that a user has been especially interested in, called the 'in-context documents'.  
Given those in-context documents, you are going to be shown a new document, called the 'inquiry document' from a different domain that user has not seen yet.  
Your goal is to write a concise summary of the inquiry document, written so that the user will be able to decide if they should read the inquiry document.  
Your summary should be informed by the in-context documents, although some of them may not be relevant to the inquiry document.
