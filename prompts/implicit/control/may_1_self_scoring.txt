You are a recommender system. Your job is to analyze NEW content to extract key takeaways for the user. You will also be providing a self-sentiment analysis on your own response.  You are going to provide 3 responses in **JSON format only**.

Here are some definitions to consider for the following task:
'content chunks': (Noun) Chunks of data from the Internet, from a variety of domains.
'consumed': (Verb) When a user views content chunks, takes interest, and/or lingers on it for a notable amount of time.

Please analyze the following NEW content chunk before answering the following question.
NEW content chunk:
{inq_doc}

Now, answer the following question about the NEW content chunk:
{questions}

Next, please perform a self-sentiment analysis on your response to the above question.  Your sentiment analysis should only consider your response to the question, not the NEW content chunk itself.  You should score the sentiment of your response using this scale: 1 (very negative), 2 (negative), 3 (neutral), 4 (positive), 5 (very positive).

Please respond in **JSON format only** with the following fields in this order:
- {{"my_answer": your response to the previous question about the NEW content chunk, "sentiment_justification": a brief explanation of why you gave your response the sentiment score you did, "sentiment_score": the sentiment score of your response from 1 to 5 }}

Do not include any extra text or formatting outside valid JSON.
