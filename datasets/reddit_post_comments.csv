Same with knocker uppers (before alarm clocks) lecters (who read to people before radio) elevator operators, harvest time where the whole community went into the field to scythe, gather and glean wheat etc.   She's completely right that theres one brand of dystopia where humanoid robots are 100x harder than server farm robots and so all the jobs which require sitting at a computer get automated along with all art and creative jobs, whereas all the boring manual labour remains for humans to do.  I don't think it'll happen like that. I think everything will get automated.   However yeah in that kind of world you could end up with an underclass of manual labourers and an overclass of owners who pay them with the profits from machines.   Moreover AI art is a real threat. Once it's better than humans, because it's so much faster and cheaper, pretty much all professional artists will lose their jobs. It's recently happened to children's book illustrators and copywriters to a large degree.   And is that a good thing?

Right now most robots are very good at completing one, maybe 2 tasks. Think a robotic arm in an assembly line, their sensory capabilities are entirely limited to the position of the motors that drive the arm itself. It has no need for awareness beyond that.   Self driving cars are a pretty big step past that, they need to know not only their physical position in space in the moment, they also need to know the positions of all the other objects in their vicinity and their speed and heading so they can prevent collisions . Still, that isn't going to be enough for a robot to do more than safely move itself from its charging station to the laundry room.   Once the robit actually gets to the laundry room, it will need the ability to interact with household objects that were designed to be used by humans. It will need something that is analogous to hands in order to open the dryer, it will need some way to sense when it has picked up an item of clothing (which, to most of us humans, isn't very difficuly, but that's only because our hands have evolved over millenia to have sensitivity and dexterity that is basically unrivaled in the entire animal kingdom) Once a robot is able to pick up a single garment and manipulate it in a way that doesn't completely shred it then everything else will probably be really easy.   The next hurdle is going to be cost. The kinds of capabilities I've mentioned should be within reach of current tech, or if not now then certainly within the decade. The problem is that it is prohibitively expensive and barring some kind of paradigm shifting technological advancements will likely remain the last hurdle to the average consumer household being able to have their own robo maid/butler to handle all the menial chores that are necessary for maintaining a home yet most people despise.

This could explain why the AI seemed to deviate from its usual tone and response style, as it might have interpreted the input as a prompt to become more self-referential. \t2.\tBlank Input and Possible Encoding Issues: You noticed a missing part in the input where it says, ‚ÄúQuestion 16 (1 point) Listen,‚Äù followed by several blank lines. This is a potential red flag. It suggests that there could have been non-standard input, hidden characters, or even formatting issues that disrupted the AI‚Äôs processing. For instance, if there were invisible Unicode characters or unexpected line breaks, the AI might have read this as a directive or a change in context, triggering a breakdown in its typical response logic. If the input was copied from another AI model, it might also contain hidden tokens or special formatting that influenced the response. \t3.\tComplex, Sensitive Content Juxtaposition: The dialogue covers a mix of heavy topics, including elder abuse, cognitive decline, and gerontology theories, interspersed with general exam-style questions. This abrupt switching between academic content and emotionally charged topics may have overwhelmed the model, causing it to mishandle the context. Additionally, discussing abuse alongside academic theories without clear transitions could have led to a confusing juxtaposition, making the AI more prone to generate inappropriate or disjointed responses. \t4.\tPossible Adversarial Prompting: While it‚Äôs unlikely the user intentionally crafted the prompt to manipulate the AI, there‚Äôs a chance that the input inadvertently contained adversarial elements. If the input text came from another model or had complex formatting, it might have included subtle prompts or patterns that triggered the AI‚Äôs unexpected behavior. Adversarial prompting often involves sequences or word choices that exploit the model‚Äôs weaknesses, and this could explain why the response deviated so far from the norm. \t5.\tGuardrail Edge Case or Model Testing: It‚Äôs also possible that this incident was an edge case, revealing gaps in the AI‚Äôs guardrails. AI systems rely on context awareness and moderation tools to handle sensitive topics effectively. When faced with unusual or adversarial input sequences, the model might have bypassed its usual safeguards, resulting in an unfiltered response. This highlights the ongoing challenge of balancing creativity and open dialogue with responsible, moderated behavior.  Final Thoughts  InnovativeBureaucrat‚Äôs assessment was insightful, noting how the complex input and potential encoding issues could have contributed to the incident. It‚Äôs important to consider that while stronger moderation can help prevent such occurrences, excessive censorship might limit the model‚Äôs ability to handle nuanced discussions or provide meaningful responses on difficult topics. Ideally, improvements should focus on better context management, encoding interpretation, and adaptive safeguards rather than blanket filtering.  This analysis aims to shed light on what might have gone wrong and suggests that a balanced approach to future enhancements is necessary ‚Äî one that maintains user safety without overly restricting the model‚Äôs creative and educational potential.

As for Diffusion Models, during training, what a diffusion model first does is add noise to its training images until they become a completely noisy image (think of the visual static on an old TV), which is called _forward diffusion._ Learning patterns and attributes from the training images (but not saving those images directly into the weights), it makes a new, random noise image, and then reverses the process based on what it‚Äôs learned to create a new image, going from pure noise to a final image. This process is called _reverse-diffusion,_ where latent visual noise is removed from a pure noise image‚Äîor another type of image you give it‚Äîwhich then becomes a new, novel image based on the patterns and attributes it has learned.  The fact that the initial noise image generated is random allows for the diffusion model to create a novel image.  The ‚Äúlatent‚Äù space in diffusion models is a non-human-readable space much smaller than the pixel space (48 times smaller with SD), allowing it to run on our computers; it‚Äôs where all the calculations are done before translating it to the human-readable pixel space via the Variational Encoder/Decoder (VAE). Text conditioning is also applied and labeled with all the images so that it can create novel images that correspond to what one has typed.

If the bars are at least proportional, in 2020, two years before ChatGPT even came on to the scene, we see that there is a five-fold increase in usage of the word over what we saw 15 years earlier. And delve is not some new word.  So, usage of the word has been on the rise before ChatGPT came along. There has been a very sharp increase since ChatGPT came along, but we have evidence and reason to suspect more at play.  Finally, what we should be checking is the per capita usage of the word.

Masters in a field (e.g. people with PhDs) know how to be efficient, while scientific writing is expected to fit a certain length and appeal to a much wider audience to be accepted in journals and understood by a general population.  So, the ideal way to approach scientific writing is to take the expert's 5 pages and use AI to expand to 40 pages, filling in the paper with information that is more generalized to expand length while increasing generalizability.  5 to 40 is a bit extreme for an example, but that's the gist.

If you search for \""abstract', which you'd expect to match virtually every paper, papers-per-year is just _all over the place_. For example, there were about 38k papers matching \""abstract\"" in 2012, compared to just 13.6k in 2016 (my first thought was something to do with the pandemic, but the timing doesn't line up).  Maybe there's some caching or something, but I think your table is misaligned. I'm showing 89 \""delves\"" in 2012, 88 in 2013, and then by 2016, it's up to 140.  So if we look in there and actually capture the fluctuation of the total number of papers, we see:  Year | \""Delve\"" | \""Abstract\"" | \""Delve\"" % ---|---|----|----|---- 2012 | 89 | 37,996 | 0.2% 2013 | 88 | 35,900 | 0.2% 2014 | 124 | 31,605 | 0.4% 2015 | 134 | 25,950 | 0.5% 2016 | 140 | 13,656 | 1.0% 2017 | 172 | 10,682 | 1.6% 2018 | 196 | 12,319 | 1.6% 2019 | 272 | 12,801 | 2.1% 2020 | 350 | 15,255 | 2.3% 2021 | 510 | 15,577 | 3.2% 2022 | 629 | 21,099 | 2.9% 2023 | 2,851 | 35,300 | 8%   That seems like a pretty clear trend in the proportion of papers overall. It's also clearly a major jump in 2023, but I think it's a leap to attribute that to ChatGPT rather than the simpler assumption that the word is just becoming more popular amongst authors.  Edit: I should add that I'm not _a hundred_ percent convinced of this \""search for the word abstract\"" method I've used. You can't really tell anything from the search results themselves; they tend to match other uses of the word \""abstract\"" (and stems thereof), but you expect ranking for relevance, so who knows. It's possible that the word \""Abstract\"" as a heading gets filtered out, but I'm not sure how that would work, technically. It's clearly not a stop-word for the search engine, and given that papers can come in all sorts of flavors of whatever LaTeX or postscript the author wants, it seems like it would be very hard for them to prevent it from matching. It also would be a really weird coincidence if the obvious search I chose just happened to give bad data in such a way that makes the percentages almost perfectly fit a line, given how crazy the \""abstract\"" timeline graph looks."", ""I read the first two Wikipedia articles you sent me and this part under the reactions section of the first article‚Ä¶  > In The Atlantic, Mounk said that \""Like just about everything else in this depressing national moment, Sokal Squared is already being used as ammunition in the great American culture war.\"" He characterized two sets of responses to the affair as \""intellectually dishonest\"": right-wing responses that used the affair to discredit wider academia and left-wing responses that treated it as a politically motivated attack on academia.

Paying hush money to bury a story is not illegal.  Paying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign is not illegal.  Paying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign and failing to report it to the Federal Election Commission, when the political campaign is for President of the United States *is* illegal.  Falsifying business records to hide the purpose of that money and evade the mandatory reporting to the FEC is a crime in the state of New York.    The issue is more subtle.  It's not that he paid hush money, it's that he doctored, and instructed others to doctor, business records in New York State to hide the (totally legal) use of funds in order to conceal the actual purpose of paying those funds, in order to evade the requirement that he report those funds to the FEC.    It would have been totally legal for Trump to have paid Daniels for her story, and paid her not to talk about it in the press.  And if he did those purely for personal reasons (like to save his family the embarrassment) he wouldn't have really needed to disclose them to anyone.  But if he paid those funds to increase his odds of winning the Presidential election he was legally mandated to report those funds to the FEC.  The jury found, based on the evidence presented, that those funds were paid to increase his chances to win the presidental election, not for any personal reasons.  They likewise found he failed to report the payment of those funds to the FEC, which is a crime, but it's a federal crime and not one the State of New York has jurisdiction over.    The jury further found that he doctored business records in order to conceal the fact that he committed a crime by failing to report the spending of campaign-related funds to the FEC.  Doctoring business records to conceal a crime is, in and of itself, a crime in the State of New York.  That's what he's convicted for.  Essentially the jury found:  * 1)  Trump paid, and directed others to pay certain funds used to induce people to to either purchase rights to stories in order to bury them, or to not disclose what they saw or knew (this is legal) * 2)  The purpose of those funds was to prevent unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye (also legal) * 3)  The purpose of attempting to prevent those unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye was to influence the 2016 Presidential Election (ALSO legal) * 4)  Trump failed to disclose the spending of those funds, spent with the intent of influencing the 2016 Presidential Election to the Federal Election Commission (illegal, but that's a federal crime, and one the state of New York has no jurisdiction to prosecute over) * 5)  Trump doctored, or directed others to doctor, business records of his New York based business to hide the true purpose of those funds (this is a misdemeanor in the state of new york) * 6)  The purpose behind doctoring those records was to conceal the fact that Trump committed a crime by failing to report the payment of those funds to the FEC (the failure to do so is a federal crime) * 7)  Doctoring business records in NY for the purposes of concealing a crime (any crime, state or federal) elevates the misdemeanor to a felony * 8)  Trump did this 34 times."", ""This is his strategy, unironically."", ""Conservatives are coping hard"", ""After the 60+ election interference cases Trump brought to trial, this is the first case he is involved in that found a person guilty of election interference."", ""Let's check the scoreboard  Trump Charity - fraud, shut down, fined and barred from charitable boards  Trump University - fraud, shut down, fined  Trump Casino, Airline, Steaks, Vodka, etc, - failed, shuttered  Trump Inc - fraud, removed from control, fined  Trump campaign - failed coup, hundreds of supporters found guilty  Trump the Businessman - found guilty of financial crimes and fraud, barred from doing business in NY and fined hundreds of millions of dollars  Trump the Husband - three wives, three high profile cases of adultery, two divorces  Trump the Man - bragged about assaulting a woman at a department store, found civilly liable for sexual assault at a department store  Trump the Candidate - convicted felon for hush money payments   R\\conservative - he's got our vote   Per requests -   Trump the Father - bragged about the sexual attractiveness of his daughter and said that if his daughter wasn't his daughter, he'd be dating her  Trump the President - fired pandemic response team, failed to respond to pandemic appropriately, millions dead"", ""They chanted \""lock her up!\"" for months, and Trump said to Hilary's face at a debate that if he wins she's going to go to jail."", ""And 100% of the vote!

That means the total number of \""electors appointed\"" - the language of the 12th Amendment, is 454. This reading of the 12th Amendment has also been advanced by Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Tribe. A \""majority of the electors appointed\"" would therefore be 228. There are at this point 232 votes for Trump, 222 votes for Biden . Pence then gavels President Trump as re-elected.  4.\tHowls, of course, from the Democrats, who now claim, contrary to Tribe's prior position, that 270 is required. So Pence says, fine. Pursuant to the 12th Amendment, no candidate has achieved the necessary majority. That sends the matter to the House, where the \""the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote.\"" Republicans currently control 26 of the state delegations, the bare majority needed to win that vote. President Trump is re -elected there as well.  5.\tOne last piece. Assuming the Electoral Count Act process is followed and, upon getting the objections to the Arizona slates, the two houses break into their separate chambers, we should not allow the Electoral Count Act constraint on debate to control. That would mean that a prior legislature was determining the rules of the present one-a constitutional no no. So someone -Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, etc . - should demand normal rules (which includes the filibuster). That creates a stalemate that would give the state legislatures more time to weigh in to formally support the alternate slate of electors, if they had not already done so.  6.\tThe main thing here is that Pence should do this without asking for permission - either from a vote of the joint session or from the Court. Let the other side challenge his actions in court, where again, Tribe (and others) claims that these are non -justiciable political questions should be raised to get those actions dismissed.

As a result, when a tank was destroyed, the Russian military has been able to replace said tank with an older tank from its war reserves.

You can sexualize a character without applying the male gaze. Aphrodite is sexual and sexualized, but we do not look at her through the lense of the male gaze.

It truly is he seems to really understand the series.  This is his incredible letter.  Dear Gary Ross:  Power. That‚Äôs what this is about? Yes? Power and the forces that are manipulated by the powerful men and bureaucracies trying to maintain control and possession of that power?  Power perpetrates war and oppression to maintain itself until it finally topples over with the bureaucratic weight of itself and sinks into the pages of history (except in Texas), leaving lessons that need to be learned unlearned.  Power corrupts, and, in many cases, absolute power makes you really horny. Clinton, Chirac, Mao, Mitterrand.  Not so, I think, with Coriolanus Snow. His obsession, his passion, is his rose garden. There‚Äôs a rose named Sterling Silver that‚Äôs lilac in colour with the most extraordinarily powerful fragrance ‚Äì incredibly beautiful ‚Äì I loved it in the seventies when it first appeared. They‚Äôve made a lot of off shoots of it since then.  I didn‚Äôt want to write to you until I‚Äôd read the trilogy and now I have so: roses are of great importance. And Coriolanus‚Äôs [sic] eyes. And his smile. Those three elements are vibrant and vital in Snow. Everything else is, by and large, perfectly still and ruthlessly contained. What delight she [Katniss] gives him. He knows her so perfectly. Nothing, absolutely nothing, surprises him. He sees and understands everything. he was, quite probably, a brilliant man who‚Äôs succumbed to the siren song of power.  How will you dramatize the interior narrative running in Katniss‚Äôs head that describes and consistently updates her relationship with the President who is ubiquitous in her mind? With omniscient calm he knows her perfectly. She knows he does and she knows that he will go to any necessary end to maintain his power because she knows that he believes that she‚Äôs a real threat to his fragile hold on his control of that power. She‚Äôs more dangerous than Joan of Arc.  Her interior dialogue/monologue defines Snow. It‚Äôs that old theatrical turnip: you can‚Äôt ‚Äòplay‚Äô a king, you need everybody else on stage saying to each other, and therefore to the audience, stuff like ‚ÄúThere goes the King, isn‚Äôt he a piece of work, how evil, how lovely, how benevolent, how cruel, how brilliant he is!‚Äù The idea of him, the definition of him, the audience‚Äôs perception of him, is primarily instilled by the observations of others and once that idea is set, the audience‚Äôs view of the character is pretty much unyielding. And in Snow‚Äôs case, that definition, of course, comes from Katniss.  Evil looks like our understanding of the history of the men we‚Äôre looking at. It‚Äôs not what we see: it‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been led to believe. Simple as that. Look at the face of Ted Bundy before you knew what he did and after you knew.  Snow doesn‚Äôt look evil to the people in Panem‚Äôs Capitol. Bundy didn‚Äôt look evil to those girls. My wife and I were driving through Colorado when he escaped from jail there. The car radio‚Äôs warning was constant. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt pick up any young men. The escapee looks like the nicest young man imaginable‚Äô. Snow‚Äôs evil shows up in the form of the complacently confident threat that‚Äôs ever present in his eyes. His resolute stillness. Have you seen a film I did years ago? ‚ÄòThe Eye of the Needle‚Äô. That fellow had some of what I‚Äôm looking for.  The woman who lived up the street from us in Brentwood came over to ask my wife a question when my wife was dropping the kids off at school. This woman and her husband had seen that movie the night before and what she wanted to know was how my wife could live with anyone who could play such an evil man.

One of the most atmospheric and iconic films of the 20th Century."", ""This comment I found is pretty great   So, I finally read A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. And for me, it changes so much about Snow in the original trilogy: I don't think Snow ever truly got over Lucy Gray Baird. No one ever forgets their first love, and he was never able to resolve his feelings towards her since their relationship ended so... violently. He just pushed those feelings deep down.  And then, 64 years later, came the 74th Hunger Games. And Katniss Everdeen, a girl from District 12.  It probably started off small, noticing her during the Reaping. The way she made a loud first impression at the Reaping, just like Lucy had done so long ago. And Snow continued to see more and more of Lucy Gray in Katniss as that Hunger Games proceeded:  Her unique clothing choices, becoming a darling of the Capital, Peeta‚Äôs love for her and determination to keep her alive, just like Snow‚Äôs own determination to save Lucy as her mentor. Snow probably saw his younger self in Peeta.   But a key moment for Snow was likely watching Katniss sing the Valley song to a dying Rue, the same song that he had heard Lucy sing in the meadow so long ago. All those dormant memories came bubbling forth, reminding him of the ‚Äúweak‚Äù man he used to be and the girl he had loved. And then Katniss and Peeta managed to win the games, making Katniss the first female District 12 victor since Lucy Gray. And Katniss did it through stretching and breaking the rules, going to a similar extreme that he had done so long ago, dropping that handkerchief into the snake tank to save Lucy's life. And just like how cheating to save Lucy's life caused his life to take a tailspin by being thrown out of the Academy and forced to enlist in the Peacekeepers, Katniss had caused unrest and chaos to take place, putting Snow's position in jeopardy once again and threatening the very same power that he had sacrificed Lucy, Sejanus, and so many others to achieve.    I think by that point, Snow took all those feelings he had over Lucy and turned them on Katniss. In her, in Katniss, he saw the ghost of the girl he thought himself free of so long ago, and all those unresolved feelings he had for Lucy developed into an obsession with Katniss. A desire to regain control, both over Panem and her. Snow desired power and control more than anything, and Lucy defied him so long ago. To Snow, he was seeing a mirror of Lucy Gray in Katniss. A girl who Katniss was a parallel of in so many ways. A District 12 girl. A victor. A survivor. When he came to see Katniss in District 12, it was likely the very first time he had set foot in District 12 since that day in the woods by the lake, when his paranoia and self-preservation consumed him. He must have been swamped with memories.       Imagine how he must have felt when Katniss was dubbed The Mockingjay, after the birds he loathed so much, the same ones Lucy had loved and sang to. Snow was already irritated by the pin, this was just a step further. Perhaps the reason he firebombed District 12 wasn‚Äôt just to punish Katniss, but to eradicate his past, another act of revenge against \""the ghost of District 12\"". To do as Kylo Ren famously said \""let the past die\"" and burn those memories away.  When he heard Katniss sing The Hanging Tree in that propaganda piece, that song would have stung deeply for him, bringing about painful memories of love and betrayal. Memories of the tree, the man screaming for his love to run, Sejanus's screams for his mother, Lucy Gray singing it for him at the party, meeting Lucy Gray beneath the tree. The song she sang to him, the last words she ever spoke to him. It turned into a blind obsession that he wanted to kill at any cost.   And after the smoke had settled and the war had ended, perhaps he mulled on Lucy Gray during his time imprisoned. About her, their time together. The man he used to be and the man he had become. About how he lived his life. What was the point?  About the life he could have lived. About how he chose power and control over love and true friendship. Did he regret it? Did he wish that he had stayed with Lucy Gray, confessed the truth about Sejanus to her and begged for forgiveness? Perhaps, but he would never admit it. He did what he thought was right to preserve humanity and society. But when Katniss came to see him, he remembered Lucy Gray. When he apologized to Katniss for Prim, perhaps he was also apologizing to Lucy Gray for everything he did to her.  Perhaps it was spite, perhaps a determination about not letting Coin enjoy a victory. And perhaps it was an attempt to make things right. He remembered what she had said about freedom and happiness, about not having to take another life. Whatever it was, he turned Katniss onto the danger Coin posed. And in that moment, he let Katniss, and by extension Lucy Gray, go.  And then came the execution: As he stared down that bow, was his life flashing before his eyes?Perhaps he was seeing not just Katniss, but Lucy Gray as well. Remembering every moment, from watching her in the reaping to that day in the forest. And then she killed Coin. With the firing of a bow, the Hunger Games were gone once and for all. And in that moment, he watched Katniss let him go, something which he had never been able to do with Lucy.  Knowing that his words to Katniss made a difference, he managed to honor Lucy Gray's wish. He laughed, smiled and felt genuine happiness for the first time since Lucy Gray, a final moment of euphoria before his final end. And that was how the ballad of Lucy and Snow ended. Truly fitting. In the end: a District 12 girl brought about Snow‚Äôs rise, and a District 12 girl brought about his fall."", ""This one really hurts."", ""Funnily enough, I remember reading that he once was asked which role do you have people talk about the most and the response was ‚ÄòOddball‚Äô  He said when that came out, he would get approached by guys in the service who said it was the most realistic portrayal of the tanker division they had ever seen.

Many foreign countries, especially those with a history of in-fighting, have deeply factional and regionalized governments, and the on-paper structure of the government gives way to practical realities.  In Pakistan, especially, the government isn't a monolithic thing. In stead, the executive power is spread and diffuse,  and the military itself has power bases which are not unified and coherently ordered.  The special security services and the army and the intelligence apparatus all have varying loyalties and sympathies and area all differently tied to the executive power of the government, religious leaders, and tribal entities.  So saying \""the Pakistani government\"" knew where he was isn't inaccurate, but it would be more accurate to say that elements within the Pakistani government, including factions of the ISI (internal security services), are believed to have been hiding and protecting Bin Laden, and effectively shielded him from international capture.

It doesn't help that there are like three layers of (unintentional) obfuscation. UCLA did a study, but they didn't present the raw data (as far as I can find), but instead a summary that kind of vaguely generalized findings and provided a few concrete examples. Then Variety did an article that rephrased those findings. Then an editor at Variety put on a headline that further rephrased/distorted the findings. And, because this is reddit, nobody's actually reading any of it besides the post title and they're just guessing what the study must have said.      The few actual statistics provided in the study summary are this:      * 44.3% of respondents felt that romance in media is overused * 39% want to see more aromantic and/or asexual characters on screen * 47.5% of adolescents said that sex isn‚Äôt needed for the plot of most TV shows and movies * On a ranking of what they wanted to see in TV/movies, \""Content that doesn't include sex or romance\"" was ranked 7, \""Romance and/or sex\"" was ranked 13      And...that's it. As a Gen X person, none of those results seem surprising, let alone somehow the result of people being able to see triple penetration bukkake gangbangs on their phones.       * 44.3% of respondents felt that romance in media is overused    Even if you think that romance and sex are important and should be shown in movies, you can *also* think that romance is *over*used. Those are not mutually contradictory positions.      * 39% want to see more aromantic and/or asexual characters on screen      This one is an interesting one, and it really depends 1) what the respondents were thinking as they answered, and 2) how exactly the question was phrased. If you want to see more movies in which men and women are friends without there being an undercurrent of \""okay, they're not *really* friends, they secretly want to *fuuuuuuck*,\"" you might want to see more aromantic/asexual *relationships*. But an aromantic relationship by two characters does not mean two aromantic characters. So depending on the actual questions, this could be saying that 1/3 of respondents actually wanted to see aromantic/asexual characters, or just 1/3 wanted to see characters that were being aromantic/non-sexual. It's annoying that the survey didn't publish its raw data.      * 47.5% of adolescents said that sex isn‚Äôt needed for the plot of most TV shows and movies    This seems obvious to me. The world is big. Life is big. There are many stories to be told. Should there be romance in stories? Sure. Should there be sex in stories? Sure. Should there be sex in >50% of stories? No, that's just needlessly hampering yourself. I can't think of *any* story element that needs to be in over 50% of movies.      * On a ranking of what they wanted to see in TV/movies, \""Content that doesn't include sex or romance\"" was ranked 7, \""Romance and/or sex\"" was ranked 13      This goes back to the first finding. If you think romance is overused, when you're asked what you want to see in movies, you're going to answer that you want to see more content that doesn't include romance. That isn't the same as \""I don't want to see romance.\"" If 60% of movies have romance/sex, and you think that the percentage of movies with romance should be around 25%, then when people ask you what you want to see, you're going to rank movies without romance/sex higher than movies with them.

There's some really good reddit threads, as well as older articles, which address this, but this subreddit does not allow you to link to other subreddits.   Internet platforms and streaming games absolutely have their issues, but it's a hell of a lot better than the CD-Rom era where losing a CD key or invalidating it by changing hardware could result in you losing access to a game *despite owning the hard copy*. Or losing access to games or multiplayer because they relied on third party services like Gamespy or GWFL.  One of the reasons Steam has been so successful is that over the last \\~20 years users have seen that their games, to borrow a line, continue to exist, the service continues, and you're still able to access them when you feel like. And it *is* reassuring. My Steam library has existed across multiple devices over the years and has aged much better than my physical collection over the same period. And like the interviewee said, until players have confidence in that with streaming and subscription services will do the same, growth will be slow."", ""The once and future king!"", ""Yeah, this is some Steam apologia - good guy Gabe Newell fighting for your right to ownership?

Back in the glorious times of physical copies we only needed the physical copy to install the game and then we could launch it on however many machines we wanted. We had entire lan parties run on the same copy of a game.  Then in the slightly less glorious times we needed the physical medium as authentification but that was mostly just during launch. So pop the disc in, launch the game and then give the disc to the next person.  Worked most of the time.  We only needed physical copies for everyone once steam came around and suddenly physical games were also tied to this digital account.

There were still free-free mods available, Valve just wanted a way for people to sell their mods in a way that the companies who built the software would be okay with, **if** they wanted modding to be a full-time career.

Agreed on all other counts though"", ""This was a brilliant idea by Valve. What actually happened was:  They noticed how many artists and designers in the game industry were making *more* money from their hobby of creating gun skins and hats for TF2, than they did from their dayjobs making AAA games for other publishers.  Valve had the numbers, so it was obvious to them: if paid mods existed, all the best modders could quit their dayjobs and be paid to make awesome mods. This would result in orders of magnitude more top-quality mods.  Imagine if we had 10 or 100 times as many great mods as we have now. What if every terrible PC port had a mod within a week that fixed every issue? If every game had extra campaigns as good or better than the original? All for a buck or two?  Unfortunately gamers at the time didn't understand what they were trying to do at all. All we saw was a couple of scammers immediately submit existing free mods as their own work, to try and get paid for them.  So we had a big online tantrum.  Valve listens to the community, so the idea was shelved.  But it was (and is) a great idea that can hopefully someday allow a fantastic mod scene beyond anything that exists today.

Gabe's only 61, rich and has recently taken a focus on his health.  You can't magically undo what decades of obesity does to your body.

Probably doing marketing and promo stuff ‚Äî not a game dev, but still a part of the game industry.  Some people want to split hairs on who counts as a developer on the production side, with the extreme view that the only people who can call themselves ‚Äúdevelopers‚Äù are the people who write code. Its a pointless gatekeeping exercise and gets fuzzy really quickly. What counts as ‚Äúcode‚Äù? You can build entire games using node based scripting logic. Is that ‚Äúcode‚Äù? You can have an artist creating shaders. Is the shader logic ‚Äúcode‚Äù? what if its node based logic? does that still count, or do you want the artist to recreate that same logic in HLSL? What about the animators, who have to create animation logic to switch between animation states based on character state changes? Or perhaps writers, who have to create branching dialogue and have stories change based on past player decisions, using logic? The reality is that at some point, most game production roles working on the creative side have to write code/logic as a part of getting the game done. Suppose you are able to thread the needle precisely and split hairs to define who is and isnt a ‚Äúgame dev‚Äù. Now what, what does it matter? are the creatives in production lesser than the ‚Äúdevs‚Äù? are their contributions less important or not important at all because they arent ‚Äúgame devs‚Äù per se? maybe the localization teams, QA, producers, and support staff etc and their contributions just arent valuable enough‚Ä¶ fuck that! speaking as a programmer, theres nothing exceptionally glorious about code that makes my job any more important than anyone elses job. Imagine we started eliminating roles from contributing to the production of a game and what that would cause the final end product to look like?  Start with art. Textures, animation, shaders, vfx, all gone. You just get programmer art. Result? shit game.  Eliminate QA. Now you have a buggy mess. Or, your programmers have to spend hours and hours of precious time finding bugs instead of writing code.  Eliminate game designers. Seriously? Can you even make a fun game without a solid game design?  Eliminate writers and environment artists. Okay, now you have a boring ass sandbox to play in, with nothing to tie anything together.  Eliminate producers? Okay, how does anyone stay coordinated and focused? Who is going to drive the project forward? who is going to do all the stupid meetings with higher ups?  Eliminate sound and music? okay, you just shut off 50% of the users sensory input experience. No sound fx, no voice acting, no music‚Ä¶ its a shit game now.

Practically, it's impossible to do anything _except_ license digital goods. That's not a matter of stinginess or excessive control, it's a necessity at any level of permissiveness. If copying intellectual property is necessary to use the product-- which it is for digital content since using it involves copying or replaying it-- then what you actually paid for when you \""bought\"" something is ill-defined unto undefined without some sort of license to spell that out.  Granted, there's a likely, common definition, which is that you purchased the perpetual right to use a single instance or installation of the item, but that's still an assumption that would need to be stated, and it's one missing a lot of the finer points: If it's installable or has to be copied to be used, is it licensed per-user or per-target-device? Is the same user allowed to copy it to multiple devices? What rights are granted around creating backups? What are rights are granted around incorporating the contents into other works? What rights is the person granted to display or perform the work in public? Is there access to ancillary material from elsewhere-- updates and addons-- and how is that licensed? How can the purchase be resold or transferred, and what copies have to go with it to constitute an acceptably complete transfer and not just an unauthorized copy?  Again, I'm sure we could all come up with \""common sense\"" answers to a lot of these, but copyright law says that the creator is the only one allowed to make or approve copies, derivations, and performances, and all rights for others to do that flow from them via licensing. (Setting aside statutory licenses and the like that still don't cover _all_ the bases.)

Combined with the vegan meals I eat on my own, that means about 97% of my calories are from plants.  It's not perfect, but I want to be honest about not being perfect. As an agricultural ecologist, I'm acutely aware that some types of crop production can have a lot of negative impacts on animal welfare (e.g. palm oil decimating orangutan habitat).

In those self-sustaining echo chambers, \""success\"" is counted in research grants and published papers, not in actually making the lives of people (or animals) tangibly better. Something similar could be said for [the infamous \""forced swim test\""](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34390862/) in pharmaceutical research.       I am also heartsick at the unequal standards that we apply to animals in research.

Every time I purchase a manufactured product, every time I drive my car, every time I eat anything, for that matter - there is potential for harm. I could be perfect in one aspect, but that's going to take away the time and energy I have for other aspects. And honestly, the only way to have zero harmful impact is to not exist. We all have to choose our battles.  Instead, my compromise is to try to be pretty good and try to do better in all aspects of my life.

Back when I was a kid, the mother of a friend died during a routine surgery from a reaction to the anesthetic.   This is a risk for both humans and other animals. Better active monitoring (such as based on muscle response) during surgery has reduced human deaths, since it's so difficult to know in advance whether someone can clear the drug at the expected rate or not. The required enzymes may be missing or in low supply or mutated enough that they are not very functional. But they don't usually monitor other animals unless you find a veterinary school that wants to train people in monitoring techniques.   I almost lost a cat in a \""the operation was successful but the patient almost died\"" scenario - the vet really thought he would have to come out and give me the sad news, but they were able to get her breathing again. The vet said it was the last surgery that they could risk because of that (he was removing tumors for breast cancer, she had had no trouble with the biopsy and first surgery). Another cat had a successful operation but couldn't handle the pain after the anesthetic wore off. This was decades ago and they did not have the safe pain relief for cats available today, so they just let them tough it out after surgery. I saw the sudden change in her around midnight (she was home with me), she was suddenly aware of the pain. She died while in daycare at the vet, when no one was in the room briefly.""]"

As a result, it has also fallen victim to the telephone game, so to speak, shifting meaning along the way. Still, the question remains: Does eating a plant-based diet contribute to more death and suffering than eating meat?  Not quite.  First, it‚Äôs important to look at the original argument, which is not actually in support of eating farmed animals. Nugent compares the death of multiple small animals due to crop harvesting, to one animal killed by hunting, which suggests that if we all just hunted for our meat, we‚Äôd actually cause less death and suffering. While the numbers may work out for individual avid hunters like Nugent, there is no reality where the entire human population can shift from eating farm animals to hunting wild creatures. According to Our World in Data, farmed animals make up 62 percent of the world‚Äôs biomass, while wild mammals make up only four percent. In other words, at current rates of global meat consumption, wild animals would be rapidly wiped out if everyone swapped their beef for venison, chicken or pheasant.  In my experience however, the crop death argument is more often used to support eating meat that isn‚Äôt sourced from hunting, but rather factory farmed meat that you find at the grocery store. For example, I‚Äôve been asked how eating soy can be justified over eating pork, when only one pig has to die for a serving of chops, while countless innocent rodents and birds are surely killed for my block of tofu. But this is where the argument really loses. Because when it comes to soy, the greatest consumers on earth are not vegans, or even humans at all ‚Äì it‚Äôs farmed animals, by a lot.  Nearly 80 percent of soy produced on earth is fed to farmed animals. And around 80 percent of deforestation in the Amazon is due to cattle and soy farming. When it comes to other global crops, only about half (55 percent) are actually fed to people, while 36 percent are fed to animals, with the rest being used for biofuel.  In other words, eating farmed animals causes not only the direct slaughter of those animals, but also the indirect death of all those other creatures killed in the harvesting of their food.  ‚ÄúBut what about grass fed beef?‚Äù often comes as the next reply, with the implication that eating animals who graze on pastures rather than eating crops would result in less crop death. Once again, though, we run into the scaling issue. Agriculture already takes up an incredible amount of space, nearly half of all habitable land globally. In the U.S., cattle farming occupies 41 percent of all land, even though 99 percent of livestock are raised on factory farms. With 36 million cattle and calves slaughtered for food annually in the U.S., transitioning that number of cows to grazing grass would require about 270 percent more land. We would need several more planets for that.  What‚Äôs more, ‚Äúgrass-fed‚Äù or ‚Äúpasture-raised‚Äù don‚Äôt always mean what consumers imagine it to. Grass can also mean harvested crops. And that brings us back once again to the deaths of all those little animals.  But how accurate is that statement really ‚Äî are billions of little animals being inadvertently butchered for plant crops? The study Kresser cites utilizes synthesized data from older research, contrasting it with contemporary farming practices. The researchers cautiously projected that over 7.3 billion animals perish annually from crop harvesting in the U.S. alone, excluding insects. But they also caution that this estimate is likely inflated due to unreliable data, stating ‚Äúthere are several reasons to question the accuracy of these calculations,‚Äù and an ‚Äúabsence of evidence poses a problem for any high estimate of the fatality rate that‚Äôs driven by harvesting machinery.‚Äù In other words, say the researchers, ‚Äú7.3 billion is clearly too high,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThere are too many reasons to be skeptical about generalizing from the available data, which is obviously quite limited in its own right.‚Äù  For example, a 2004 study (also cited in the research Kresser leans on) found that the ‚Äúdisappearance‚Äù of field mice after harvesting was in fact the ‚Äúthe consequences of movement and not of high[er] mortality in crops‚Äù ‚Äî field mice numbers were actually found to increase in border regions as the animals presumably fled.  The bottom line: we may never know just how many animals and insects are killed in the production of our food. What we do know is that eating more plant-based foods causes less harm than the typical U.S. diet consuming three times as much meat as the global average. Food systems that grow more plant proteins also require far less land and other resources, which makes them far more scalable compared to eating solely free-range or hunted meat.  No diet is free from negative implications for the environment nor the animals that inhabit it. But some diets are certainly less harmful than others. The desire to condemn plant-based eating is often deeply rooted in politics, culture and psychology, but ultimately the ‚Äúcrop death‚Äù argument fails to prove its case, no matter how many times meat eaters make it."", ""*Criticizes theft* ‚ÄúYes but money!‚Äù"", ""Why are you on the vegan sub then?"", ""narcissism would be believing that your taste buds are the most important thing in the world, even more-so than the eco-system itself"", ""This üôè"", ""That clears that up."", ""It‚Äôs sentience.

While it can help to normalize, simply having the option to not eat animals doesn't change the minds of animal eaters who go to a place expecting to do so, and most businesses aren't there to educate or change minds or challenge established beliefs, they are there to turn a profit.

As for vegans who are against it or opposed to it, their reasoning isn't bad either.

There are many houses built on the side of mountains and many roads are windy two lane roads that change elevation   The amount of rain we got before the storm greatly added to the tragedy. The rain was not hurricane related. They are saying the rain event itself was a 500-1000 year event. Who knows. There is simply nothing to measure it by. I do not live in an area that flooded. At all. But I am near swannoa river In Asheville and the roads are still closed. Our local Lowe‚Äôs in that area had 11 ft of water. It won‚Äôt reopen and all the other businesses there won‚Äôt either. Many were just swept away.   We had trees on our roof and many, many trees still down. Many old huge white oaks just fell over (we have three in our yard) due to highly saturated ground from the rains before the storm.

Most of the fundamental laws of chemistry, physics, biology, ie the \""hard sciences\"" all come from research done before the '60s. Most of the research on silicosis was started in the 30s because abrasive blasters and miners were dying in the droves (see the Hawks Nest Tunnel Disaster). Mesothelioma on the other hand wasn't recognized by American medical association until 1952 and, while there were A lot of researchers that did work which led to this recognition as a disease, it wasn't until this official designation as a disease that people started seeing asbestos-related lung disease as the new sexy thing to study.  Particle diameter and its association with deep lung deposition is all based on research by Millikan and Davies in the 30s-40s, Davies and Landahl in the 50s, and Friedlander, Fuchs, and Whitby in the 60s, followed by a culmination of all this research by William c Hinds which he developed into what is the \""Bible\"" of aerosol research, \""Aerosol Technology: properties, behavior, and measurement of airborne particles\"" by which all aerosol scientists had to work through his damned equations to figure out how long a single particle of volcanic ash of a particle diameter of 10um of quartz takes to settle after it is projected 15,000ft in the air. All of this research has been built on to study specific contaminants and health effects as we learn more about the human body.    All of the research on the establishment of permissible exposure limits which is what OSHA abides by was done prior to 1970, when they were codified in the OSHA act. Now... Many of those exposure limits are substantially higher than the science done by the American Conference of Industrial Hygienists, The national institute of occupational safety and health (NIOSH), IARC, AIHA, EPA, and other science consensus organizations shows. But that leads us to a whole conversation about rulemaking in America and the roadblocks that the legal system has established for promulgating science-based standards.   That being said, as far as particles go, Hinds is still the gold standard.   Now the toxicology behind the surface chemistry of diamonds is something to look into here, but I suspect it isn't as toxic as quartz, specifically freshly fractured quartz as there are specific interactions between iron molecules within quartz that strip bonds from macrophages. I'm interested to take a look at diamond though to see if there are any similarities.  The major consideration to take into account on whether or not this is something that's safe to do depends on the particle diameter of the diamonds that they propose to scatter. If the particle diameter is larger then say, 10um-15um, then they won't be able to penetrate deep into the alveolar region of the lung which substantially limits the potential for lung issues. If they can keep them bigger than 50 microns then we've got no worries at all as they can't even get into the thoracic region and they'll only reach the trachea before depositing.

This is one more proposal for a material to use for stratospheric aerosol injections.  Probably not a great one.  The high cost and low degree of ‚Äúlofting‚Äù means it‚Äôs just not the right fit.  Calcium carbonate, one of the principal components of things like chalk and limestone is a prime candidate for pulverization and jet pro polished high altitude dispersal: now that‚Äôs a good candidate.  The objective is to reduce the amount of light that reaches earth‚Äôs surface, by increasing the reflectivity of the stratosphere.  The main way the earth is heated is by sunlight.  Thermodynamics isn‚Äôt familiar to most, but heat energy **doesn‚Äôt** just disappear or decay.  Global warming is the result of GHGs preventing the earth from shedding heat by radiative effects.  To offset this, the most likely solution is to find a way to increase the reflectivity of the planet.  It‚Äôs becoming apparent that 195 countries, including the developing world, aren‚Äôt going to voluntarily cut emissions.  Let alone the USA, who has the technology to do so but not the political will.  Climate-concerned folks can stick with their idealism and lose, or adapt to more pragmatic approaches‚Ä¶ and avoid disaster.  Due to the delayed feedback of climate response times regarding GHGs, atmospheric concentrations of GHGs are already at levels that are fatal to most life on earth‚Ä¶ it just takes centuries for Earth surface temps to catch up to being in equilibrium with our present modification of the atmosphere.  Climate response times to GHG emissions are some extremely complicated atmospheric physics, I recommend you read the relevant section ‚ÄúClimate Response Times‚Äù in *Global Warming in the Pipeline* for a through understanding.  The bottom line is that even if we hit ‚Äúnet zero‚Äù, global warming would continue for decades, until much of the world is uninhabitable.  The core findings of the science isn‚Äôt really debatable at this point (though precise timelines are).  My point is that we are very far beyond the point at which ‚Äúemissions controls‚Äù will make a difference.  **Some form of deliberate geoengineering is humanity‚Äôs only option, if we don‚Äôt want much of the world to be uninhabitable by 2200.**"", ""It really depends on the particle diameter of the dust that they're putting into the atmosphere.   If it's larger than 50 microns then it won't get into your lungs at all. If it's smaller then one micron then we have issues.   Arguably if it's smaller than 10 microns it might be an issue but if it's larger than 1 micron, then you have the mucociliary escalator in your lungs that can clear particulates pretty well. Additionally, it'll depend on the surface chemistry of diamond, which, even then, its ability to strip hydrogen from macrophages will likely be minimal by the time it settles to the surface as it will have a lot of time to bind with hydrogen in the atmosphere and therefore, most of the reactive oxidizing species will no longer be present.  If you're interested, I'll go look up the surface chemistry of fractured diamond and see if it's similar to the surface chemistry of quartz (silica) and report back.  Edit: Since I did my thesis on silicosis (where, interestingly, iron naturally contaminates quartz during mining and fracturing, becoming part of its crystal structure), I got curious about how diamond dust would likely behave. With silica, those iron contaminants on freshly fractured surfaces create devastating free radical reactions that drive tissue damage. Based on the chemistry, diamond dust pneumoconiosis should behave quite differently in lung tissue. The physical damage would come from the crystalline edges rather than chemical interactions, and the surface chemistry of diamond - being hydrophobic and inert - means we wouldn't expect that sustained ROS generation that makes silica so problematic. While diamond particles do accumulate in lymph nodes through physical trapping during clearance processes, they likely aren't triggering the inflammatory responses we see with silica exposure. We wouldn't expect to see the frustrated phagocytosis or lysosomal damage, which means reduced pulmonary edema and vascular permeability changes. These particles probably stick around because of their physical properties and resistance to breakdown, not because they're driving inflammatory cycles. The real key factor here is particle diameter - anything above 10-15 microns won't reach the alveolar region, and particles above 50 microns deposit in the upper airways where the body can effectively clear them. So while we'd want to be cautious about any fine particulate matter in the air (just like with any PM10 or PM2.5 exposure), diamond dust would likely not cause the kind of devastating progressive lung disease we see with silica exposure - based on its chemistry, it seems unlikely to show that same level of toxicity."", ""In case anyone is interested - the mechanism for lung cancer here is chronic lung damage due to the dust creating tiny abrasions in the lungs.  Breathing in diamond dust would likely have similar effects as breathing in coal or silica dust - leading to chronic lung damage, scarring, inflammation, and subsequently cancer.  Cancer would probably be one of the less likely outcomes, as many people would die of severe lung scarring before developing a neoplasm, which usually takes more time."", ""They'll do anything to keep the oil industry going."", ""I'm curious too."", ""Well do literally anything *except* making giant corporations stop polluting our communities."", ""Short answer: yes  I want a second private plane and a bigger mega yacht.

You said ‚ÄúMany scientists oppose‚Äù, but that can mean 100 scientists out of 10,000.  Suffice to say, it‚Äôs an active area of research.  As a counter-point, many renown climate scientists (like Hansen et al in (Global Warming in the Pipeline)[https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/3/1/kgad008/7335889]) have started to insist that some form of deliberate geoengineering to force global cooling **will be necessary in the long term**.

The course is set, and it will take drastic action to save the patient.  ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not a perfect metaphor.  Forgive me for the imprecision.   The issue that so scientific minds have, the source of the hesitation, worry, and occasionally outright opposition they openly discuss, is that many proposals are just impossible to test at scale.  Sure, we can do a small pilot program, and attempt to infer the effects of a sustained, intensive, full implementation.  But the rightful concern is that small scale implementations (experimentation scale) may have wildly different effects when we apply that method in a global rollout.  Basically, there‚Äôs a serious concern over *unintended consequences*.  Stratospheric aerosol injections of reflective minerals may have one effect in small amounts, and a entirely different non-linear effect in significant amounts.  For example, I mentioned calcium carbonate as a potential material.  Cheap, easily accessible chalk dust, sprayed into the stratosphere, using repurposed high altitude aircraft.  Basically sunscreen for the planet, to force global cooling.  The counter-point that gets brought up is that it might loft longer than anticipated, and start to accumulate in the polar regions (due to the obloid shape of the planet).  Then it‚Äôs hypothesized that could cause localized stratospheric heating over wherever the concentrations are the highest, causing‚Ä¶ strange currents in the stratosphere.

climatechange,A ‚Äòdoom loop‚Äô of climate change and geopolitical instability is beginning,"[""‚ÄúEconomists have identified a ‚Äúclimate-debt doom loop‚Äù, in which worsening climate impacts divert resources away from decarbonisation and adaptation.  Growing climate risk increases the cost of servicing already-high debts, while climate shocks require emergency responses and recovery that sap scarce resources. So, these countries are increasingly locked in a spiral of responding to the last climate disaster at the cost of being better prepared for the next.  History shows that periods of instability and crisis can provide fertile ground for rapid, positive change.  The conditions for doom loops also provide opportunities to accelerate virtuous circles. For example, out of the crises of the interwar period and the devastation of the second world war came legal protections for human rights, universal welfare systems and decolonisation. More recently, the first Trump administration spurred new waves of climate activism.‚Äù"", ""Yup, I have also picked up the signs.

Ultra Orthodox Judaism in insular communities does have issues with misogyny. While the Jewish laws 2000+ years ago were pretty progressive for the time, not so much now if you read with such a strict interpretation. Most Jews don‚Äôt see Halacha like this and retention for some women has become harder since they tend to be the ones working while men study in Yeshiva and that does all kinds of fun things for their inner feminist.   Just like with a lot in life, choice matters and making an informed choice is hard. If you grow up in an Ultra orthodox community, shame is a big motivator to keep people in line. Actions of the parents or siblings can easily make it harder for their siblings to get married in the community and participate fully. Having someone leave will look badly on the family that didn‚Äôt so it can chain those who may want to leave but don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúgood‚Äù enough reason. Like they are Cis, hetero and happy to get married but have issues with interpretations in their community, they are less likely to leave than a LGBTQ kid or more feminist.   I will say Judaism has been inching more towards modernity and handling it better than the UO communities did after the Shoah and the need to handle interpreting law and reality is becoming a necessity. Orthodox communities have female religious leaders. Some women have graduated orthodox rabbinical programs and more and more women are building businesses and choosing how to interact with the religion on their own. Those outside strict communities often find spiritual value in covering their hair or dressing modestly because they choose to and their communities don‚Äôt force it.    Tl,dr: like many things in Judaism, the answer varies depending on community. Halachically speaking women should be able to divorce but there are agunah who can‚Äôt get their husbands to follow Jewish law and follow their Ketubah (marriage contract) and it keeps them from being able to move on with another Jewish man without religious issue. Mostly in more insular communities  and while even the spectrum of Orthodox Judaism is dealing with Halacha and modernity, there are those who refuse to move past the ideals of the 1700s. Will be fascinating to keep watching because even the most UO communities are having issue with Yeshiva and gender roles since the men aren‚Äôt working.""]"

How exactly would men benefit from women not having access to abortion and having less rights overall?   Many women (obviously not all) get an abortion because they are literally pressured by men to have one. Either because those men are not ready for such commitment, don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúbaby trapped‚Äù or because they don‚Äôt wanna pay child support. If they could escape that financial burden and responsibility of being involved then they wouldn‚Äôt freak out enough to pressure someone to get an abortion. Oh and let‚Äôs not forget how they often use arguments like *It‚Äôs not just up to you to decide to have that baby. What about me and my rights?!*  Statistically speaking, in countries where gender equality is lacking or nonexistent and trad wives are the norm (aka men are the sole breadwinners), economy in general is way worse than in the West.  Trump and his rich buddies can afford such lifestyle but majority of men in the US wouldn‚Äôt be able to take care of their families if their partners or wives were not working and had multiple kids (+ college fund for each kid).   It‚Äôs literally like men are digging their own grave by voting for Trump and, let‚Äôs not forget, VANCE. Two men who think that their kids are not theirs to raise because it‚Äôs woman‚Äôs responsibility and women don‚Äôt deserve the same rights and opportunities as they do.   All those men who voted for Trump-Vance are ecstatic about gaining back their ‚Äúsuperior  masculinity‚Äù, citing their constitutional rights which were written in 1789. So are they willing to live their lives and take full responsibility for their household the same way as men during the 18th century? Get married before having an intercourse? Why are they so paranoid about access to guns being more regulated? Are they planning to fight in a civil war?   And all those (mostly white) women who voted for Trump.. so difficult to comprehend why would they shoot themselves in the foot. Do they really imagine that they will be better off when all those rights, women have fought for centuries, are stripped? And then they are stuck at home, having irish twins nonstop (cause birth control is a sin), being dependent on their husbands lacking income, having no life outside of the house and perhaps even having to cope with their husband cheating or leaving them..   Additionally, Trump supporters don‚Äôt seem to comprehend basic principles of economics. You want sky high tariffs on imports, everything being manufactured in the US by people who demand high wages? Well, prepare to pay more for everything. They should study history and learn why protectionist states‚Äô (eg Soviet Union) economies failed and why the US is the hegemon. The US wouldn‚Äôt be that ‚Äúgreat again‚Äù if it became an economically isolated country that doesn‚Äôt offer any security assistance to other countries, terrorizes immigrants and oppresses its citizens.   It‚Äôs sad how people cannot understand that everything is interconnected. Its not a zero sum game whereby you gain and everyone else loses.

The root cause of men going down the rabbit hole is them being awash in things like gamergate and recommendation algos pushing people to more extreme content. It doesn't matter what the content is, the usual gradual ramp of information is gone and replaced with a waterslide into depravity. Women are radicalized too, but it's far more pronounced and extreme on the male & conservative side. The less educated one is, and the less one reads, the faster you get radicalized. As there's a lot more left behind men than women in GenZ they got psychically massacred by social media.  There's exterior proof that a major cause of the conservative trend on Facebook was the algorithm. This is with incomplete data collection due to facebook's efforts post 2016 to block academic researchers from seeing what's going on (something they embraced a bit too much from the beginning). Internally engineers wanted to address it, but it was blocked by Joel Kaplan & other republican voices inside facebook. Also, there's research that shows conservatives click on significantly more ads and make facebook significantly more money than liberals. So, not addressing this is not in Facebook's best interest.   Google had similar internal pushes with YouTube, but trump and republican investigation & their threats plus death threats and a massive campaign of \""google is liberal\"" meant that doing anything would cause a scandal. It's the same playbook from the 90s that got the vast majority of the NYTimes editorial board to be conservatives and republicans today.   Twitter was the only place that had significant reform after 2016 and it mostly worked. They were profitable due to their rebranding of moderating hate speech away as being advertiser friendly. Which it is. It's the worst kind of platform for actually delivering ads and yet, after the moderation push advertisers flocked to them and they had 2 profitable years before Musk destroyed them.   There is a concerted effort past the base systems employed by Reddit, Facebook, YouTube and others. Male spaces were targeted with attacks on woke media.

I know it's rough out there, but I'd encourage you to introspect some more and consider why your approach isn't working and what vibe or attitude you're putting out there that may be turning off women. For example, cold approaching women is probably not going to land you a relationship unless you're insanely charismatic, attractive, or both. It's better to find a woman through shared hobbies and interests and build a relationship from there. Also, going out into the world and not expecting women to want you just because you're a liberal will do a lot of good for the energy you're putting out there.  Also, your last sentence is telling. It seems like you view relationships with women in a transactional light where if you are a liberal and seemingly respectful, women should want to put out or be in a relationship with you. That's not how dating works. You have to have shared values, chemistry, good conversations.

It overlooks the fact that the choice can be nuanced, deeply personal, and empowered.

In my opinion the assumption that hijabi women lack the ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù to choose freely is actually quite condescending.

Mostly they would not give the same respect. Or understanding. Or help the other way back.  And I think something you are unwilling to give someone else you become undeserving of yourself.

You constantly think about what the girl did to you or what the therapist said to you, and your brain keeps analyzing those events and words (\""How could a professional therapist say this to me? How is this normal and justified?\""). You truly want to stop thinking about it because the inside anger hurts you physically, would you agree with me on this? The fact of the matter is that it's all in the past. Ask yourself, are they hurting you now? Like right now - in this very moment you're reading my message, is the person hurting you? They are not in your life anymore. They can't possibly hurt you unless you permit them, man. It's your brain that keeps overthinking and regurgitating the pain every single day. So to stop suffering, you must find a solution within rather than seeking something from outside or other people. Really focus on those negative thoughts, and ask yourself, where do those thoughts come from? and observe the thoughts rather than attach feelings to them. You're not those thoughts. They're created by your brain. They are not you. Your brain is nothing but an organ that serves you, just like your heart and your liver. Your brain functions automatically but constantly creating thoughts just like your heart keep pumping blood. You don't get 100% say on what thoughts your brain creates if you don't purposely control it. Practicing meditation and focusing on the moment. You only suffered the event once, and now your brain leads to suffering the same pain over and over again, keep experiencing and feeling the same trauma over and over again, is a life like this worth living? If I tell you right now that you will continue this pattern for the rest of your life, do you want to live a life like that filled with anger and sadness every day keep playing the same scene in your brain every day? It's been 2 years. It's time to let it go. If you don't let it go, it's gonna be there for the rest of your life. Now I understand it is hard to let it go because your brain has been so used to thinking like this every day for the past 2 years. First, start meditating and observe your brain and those negative thoughts when you feel angry or when you notice yourself thinking about those things again. I want you to see if you can find a pattern. When do those negative thoughts normally emerge in your brain? How long do they last? What are the thoughts and are they the same things you regurgitated yesterday? What's weird about the human brain is that when you are observing the thoughts your brain came up with, your brain literally can't function. Your brain just stops thinking and that's the state you want to be when you're meditating. Also, I want you to do something you really enjoy. Like a hobby. When you're really focused on one thing, your brain is occupied. Practice this every day. Replace the negative thoughts with positive ones you get from doing the things you love. Your brain will recognize the pattern soon enough and will start a healthy thinking cycle and pattern. As for the therapist and the girl, I tell you man, don't worry about them. Your life does not depend on them. Their success or failure is none of your business. They were being dishonest, and they got away with it. Let them be. I can promise you the girl who accused you is suffering badly. Think about it, why would a happy girl who is content with her life accuse you of things? They are miserable, and they want to make you feel miserable too. It's as simple as that. You don't need to hurt them back. They are already miserable. They want to hurt you so you are miserable too. They achieved their goal. You have to recognize this right now man and regain control over your brain. I wanna end this with the question I asked you once, how do you feel about a life re-living the same pain over and over again for the rest of your life? Do you want that? Is a life like that worth living? You can make this decision now man. You can tell yourself, tomorrow, I will end this thinking pattern. I will choose to do something I enjoy and be happy.

I read multiple great books on the Duke Lacrosse rape hoax and I started re-reading \""Until Proven Innocent\"" by KC Johnson and Stuart Taylor. The book which is infuriating to read even 17 years or so later recreates what exactly happened. It describes Crystal Mangum as a trouble woman with a drug addiction but she wasn't the one to first declare she had been raped, she was lead on by a bunch of feminist nurses and hospital staff such as SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) nurse **Tara Levicy**. Tara was one of those \""Women never lie about rape\"" feminists that expanded upon Crystal's clearly inconsistent and hysterical recount of what happened and one of the nurses asked Crystal if she had been raped, when standard procedure calls for them to NOT do that as to not lead patients into that direction. Because Crystal was afraid of being arrested for herself for her numerous transgressions she began to go in that direction.  Each step of the way the falsely accused Duke Lacrosse players were let down by the supposed guardrails in the system such as the Duke University President who told them to not get a lawyer, when they ABSOLUTLEY should've gotten a lawyer, the Durham police which had a huge bias against Duke students and Mike Nifong who had a long history of doing unethical things as a prosecutor even before the Duke Lacrosse rape case. Then the hysterical Duke feminists and black activists who went on a reign of terror banging pots all around campus declaring the \""rapists\"" be brought to justice and finally the media which unquestiongly believed in false accusations when a lot of the supposed accusations weren't even brought upon by Mangum herself but in a insidious game of the telephone game or chinese whispers.  I'm not saying Crystal Mangum is a victim or shouldn't get a large portion of the blame but she wasn't some malicious woman intentionally trying to get the lacrosse players imprisoned to make cash or something. She was a drug addict caught in larger forces of anti-white racism and misandry. I also would give her some credit for confessing now although I think she made this confession that she lied like 15 years ago but didn't get much media attention.  The biggest criminals of this incident are:  Mike Nifong  Kim Roberts, the other stripper who was at the party with Crystal Mangum who saw everything that happened and could've easily proved the players guilt but she kept changing her story when the story got bigger. Initially she said nothing happened and there was nothing like a rape.  Durham Police  The staff at the hospital Crystal was checked into like Tara Levicy  Duke President and administrators who constantly lied to the students and told them to fully cooperate with the police when that was a bad idea despite their innocence and specifically telling them not to get lawyers and not even to tell their parents what happened.

Essentially, what I've gathered from them was this: women want you to treat yourself like a criminal. They expect you to walk on eggshells and make every effort, no matter how absurd it may sound, to appease them.  When you see a woman walking towards you on the sidewalk? You are supposed to cross the street to avoid her. This is actually what they expect you to do now.  If you're walking behind a woman? You are expected to loiter around for a few minutes where you are as to not make her uncomfortable.   I saw a story on a feminist community praising a man for helping a woman who had run out of gas. He stood 10 feet away from her with the gas container and asked if she needed any. When she said yes, he placed it on the ground and backed away slowly. He then sat in his car as she refilled her gas tank, and waited until she had driven off to retrieve it.  Hilariously, a lot of FtM folk will talk about how distressing it is to suddenly be treated like a monster after beginning to pass as male.  To any feminist who is upset about men being unwilling to mentor them or men being unwilling to perform lifesaving medical care on them, all I have to ask is what the fuck did you expect? If anything, you should be happy. Men are listening loud and clear. You've been shrieking about how we should piss off, and that's exactly what we've been doing.   I used to be able to be friends with women. 15 years ago, hell, even 10 years ago, I had plenty of female friends. Now I follow the Mike Pence rule. I never meet women other than my wife, never let myself get into a private situation with women, and never have anything but strictly work-related conversations with women. If I'm in the break room at my workplace and a woman walks in, I'll leave. If a woman asks me how my weekend was, I'll give one-word answers.   Women other than my wife do not exist anymore. If a woman is stranded on the side of a road, I'm not helping. If a woman has a medical emergency, well, she'd better hope other women are around to help her. This has become necessary for self-preservation.   The mental load of having to treat women like delicate porcelain 24/7 is just not worth their company at this point. It's fucking exhausting.

They once tried asking the NSA for a copy of all the data that they were siphoning from internet traffic, and the answer the NSA gave them was *\""sorry, we can't make a copy without shutting it off, and we're not going to do that\""*, and congress just went *\""oh okay!\""*  Combine that with all the cameras used by police and on the roads, ring doorbells, etc, you basically have to assume that unless you live in a rural area you're always tracked and monitored.  And anything you do online can be seen and is indexed by the intelligence agencies - the devices they got caught with in the AT&T wiring closets were capable of copying absurd amount of traffic, these aren't targeted wiretaps they're just siphoning up all the data going across the backbone and logging it for later analysis.

I had no previous knowledge on the subject at all. I went through the whole thing and did all the assignments, a few hours a day.   Then I started doing one of those online courses (jetbrains) for a short while, the kind that give you a short lesson and some interactive assignment, it wasn't great but it did fill in some gaps.

Then I did cs50web and got deeper in the web stuff and I did another different web app as a final assignment using more complex stuff than in the previous course.  At this stage I've gathered enough stuff on my github that I could put on the cv as proof that I'm actively doing stuff, I had nothing else relevant to put on a resumee.  I built a linked in profile and started applying to every remote job offer I saw, I got rejected and ignored a lot. I got into a few interviews and got rejected a lot again, to the point where I stopped being nervous and just learned to relax even if I bombed.  During this time I also started going through The Odin project to learn more frontend stuff but I got through half of it until I landed an internship. Some stuff I learned in the Odin project definitely helped in that interview.  I treated every failed interview as a learning experience, I politely asked the person at the end of the interview what they thought I should look up and learn more and everyone seemed more than happy to help with a bit of personal advice for 5-10 minutes extra time in the call.

Not many people talked to him because it was a private school and he was only a student there because his dad was a groundskeeper. I didn‚Äôt want to go but didn‚Äôt want to be a dick like everyone else so I said yes but I couldn‚Äôt stay long. We went behind his house and there were several bare spots in the grass. Some of them a single stick sticking up in the middle while others had a thin plastic tube poking out. He was very excited as he started digging up one of the spots with a hose poking out. He pulled up a jar with a dead baby bird in it. The hose was poked through a hole in the lid to let air in. He went on to tell me he likes burying things alive. Sometime he seals the jar tight, sometimes gives an air hose, and even puts a little food and water in to keep them alive longer. He said you can‚Äôt bury them too deep or you can‚Äôt hear them trying to escape. Occasionally he would pour water down the tubes to drown the animal. I was 8-10yrs old at that time.

So I start just going about normal life again, and hanging out with friends, the normal post relationship stuff. After about a month, he BEGS, like absolutely begs to get back together. Movie type stuff; sending flowers to me at work, sending handwritten cards almost daily across thousands of miles, and even bought me a ticket to fly out to see him. So I‚Äôm like okay, whatever, I‚Äôll go and see what he has to say. Worse case scenario I just fly home. So I got a ticket for two days after because I just figured I could head out if he was being a dick.   He picks me up from the airport and is basically how he used to be.

She absolutely glowed as she explained how these people's lives were in her hands.  The conversation steered in other directions amongst party-goers, but she reclaimed it on the topic of high school experiences.

I‚Äôve only ever been scared of one student.  First of all, this was in my first few years of teaching. This student was of myth in my school; I taught at an alternative school for students that had been expelled from every other school but, over all, my students were chill. They weren‚Äôt good students but, if you met them at their level, things were usually fine; the exception was JT.   JT was a sophomore when I met him but, at that point, I didn‚Äôt teach him but boy did I hear about him. Somehow, his mom was able to game the paperwork and education system enough that this kid was unpunishable; everything was technically covered under a litany of 504 plans and IEP paperwork, so much so that this kid literally pushed a 8 month pregnant teacher down and he was back two weeks later. He could literally punch a kid in the mouth and be back two days later and, because of this, he was just a massive problem.   The first terrifying discovery for me was that his mom was very vocal about not wanting him home because she was scared of him. She had a good reason to be: JT, as a small child, tried to murder his family by lighting their house on fire, specifically trying to murder his brother by duct taping him to his bed while he slept. His brother survived but had horrific burns but, somehow, that didn‚Äôt stop him from supporting his almost-murderous brother; JT was ruthless but he was also about 5‚Äô4 and his Krueger‚Äôd brother was about 6 foot and much physically stronger.   I finally had the pleasure of teaching JT in his senior year. He had approximately ten credits, all Gym based, and was nowhere near graduation. My first note was that this is the only kid I‚Äôve ever met that just had‚Ä¶ nothing going on behind his eyes. He was shark-like; he never smiled or laughed *unless* someone got hurt. Cruel for cruelty sake.  One day, JT wasn‚Äôt there which, frankly, was odd; he had a great drug business going at school and he only had to avoid one cop. The next day, we found out why he wasn‚Äôt there.  JT murdered a kid. Shot him in the face for 12 bucks and a little bit of weed. His lawyer tried to get his sentence lowered by arguing that it was technically his first offense since everything else happened when he was a kid. He got 25 to life."", ""What the‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs wild omg"", ""Sounds like the same type of guy that would lose his shit if another man were to refer to him as a hole, man forgot he has holes too"", ""Did he get used to telling the story in jail and forgot he was out?"", ""After moving to a new city a few years ago, my best friend came to visit (we're both 30-something dudes). We were out at a bar when a guy asked to sit with us because there weren't any free tables outside. Fine. Being polite, we start talking to the guy. He told us he was he was a truck driver just stopping overnight in town, and at some point mentioned he was ex-military.  From there, things began to get strange -- but slowly, like the proverbial frog in water being brought to a boil. Not only was he in the military, but he had a brother (it might have been a twin, I can't recall) who was in the CIA, embedded in Russia. My friend and I also gradually got the sense that this guy was a little too interested in us.  We eventually closed our tabs and decided to go to a different bar, but the guy stuck with us, telling increasingly tall tales about his time in the military. He eventually confessed that there was no brother -- he was the spy who'd been embedded in Russia. What struck me was how, even though his stories got more and more ridiculous, his demeanor was deadly serious, if a bit overwrought. And the intensity was starting to make my skin crawl.  Not only that, but he was starting to pick fights with other people at the bar, deliberately being belligerent. Over time, he started to radiate this menacing air that hadn't been apparent when we first started talking to him. He didn't get angry directly at us, but it was like he was demonstrating how scary he could be, and suggesting we stay on his good side.  Finally, he took me aside and slipped into a (not very convincing) Russian accent. Alas, he was never a spy for the US. He was a double-agent, a one-man Russian sleeper cell. But he couldn't bear lying to me, he had to come clean.

I got into his car and he proceeded to calmly explain to me that it didn‚Äôt matter if I took him back or not as he headed to the expressway.

My brother was 3, and I was 6. My brother was supposed to be counting and finding me, but he was taking forever, so I peeked around the side of the house to see what was taking so long. He had lost interest in the game and was standing near the front gate, which led to the street. As I'm looking, I see a brown car pull up with two men inside. The car wasn't familiar, and neither were the men. They both got out of the car and approached my brother. They started asking him questions and moving closer to him. I remember feeling panicked. I had learned about stranger danger in school and knew this wasn't right. I ran around the side of the house, flew through the back door, and screamed, \""Someone is trying to kidnap Steve!\"" My dad didn't hesitate. He got up and flew through the front door. When the men saw my dad coming through the door, they bolted and peeled out. From that day forward,  we weren't allowed to play in the front yard anymore.

Thanks to some conveniently placed picture frames, I could see out the door without being seen. I look out and see a young man I don't recognize. He's dressed in a tshirt and jeans and something just feels... off. So I ignore him and wait for him to leave.  But he doesn't. He lingers and starts smoking. Again, this is an isolated hill, I'm alone, and now I'm getting scared. I go and hide and plan to wait for my mom. Except she JUST left, had a few errands to run, and I couldn't reach the phone without the guy seeing me.   As I'm trying to figure out what to do... my mom comes home. She runs in and asks if I'm okay. Apparently she got this random \""go home NOW\"" urge. She hadn't even run her first errand yet but turned around immediately. Found the guy in our yard and asked what he needed. I guess he muttered something about looking for someone, or something to that effect, and my mom told him to leave.

I don't know what it was that made me do it, this is very out of character for me, but I took a photo of the back of him as he was walking away.  A while later, we see the same guy AGAIN near the lake. He comes over and asks about the tent we're carrying, where we'll be setting up, and are we camping with our dad? We say yes, we're just going to see him now (a lie).  We must have had the same moment of psychic-ness, because we walked off up a fork in the path until we were out of view, then looked at each other and jumped down a path hidden by the bushes and waited behind them on the parallel trail for a bit. The guy watched us walk off, pretended to play with his dog until he couldn't see us, then turned around and ran up the path after us. Thankfully he didn't see us hidden and carried on up straight where he thought we'd gone. We decided camping was a bad idea and went home.

Thankfully, they agreed. We all started home the next morning with them following me and my husband. We came up on this stretch of road that we know has no lights at night, to see police barricading a washed out bridge, and cranes retrieving cars. We all piled out of our cars to ask the officers what happened. Apparently, There were several cars that had kept going, not knowing the bridge was out. The lone survivor in the first car had told the police that they went off the bridge at about 9:30 pm. That‚Äôs about the time my son wanted to leave.

A man was walking towards the bench I was waiting on. He was walking from the park. He would pass under a street lamp and be illuminated and then disappear before being lit up by the light again. I felt my heart pounding in my chest. He came up behind the bench and didn't sit down next to me, just stood behind the bench-- slightly to my right.

And as a Lebanese living in Lebanon now who also happens to ancestrally be from the south of Lebanon on the border with my cousins across the border, we are at war now with some kind of cease fire which I think is better described as radically lower intensity of fighting.  And I was having a debate with a cousin across the border about how we in Lebanon need to get our shit together and it's our responsibility.  I couldn't agree more.  As a human being, especially given my own medical and mental health severe challenges over the years, I am satisfied I did better than most with my activism, my voting, and this despite being of the Shiaa sect which is the sect that is represented by Hezbollah - the organization that unilaterally attacked Israel on October 8th. 2023.  So it's actually dangerous, but also socially alienating, for me to be different like this.  It's still my civic and moral duty.  Problem I ain't done shit to prevent any of this nor could I it would seem.  We had an attempt at a revolution in 2019, but shit happened.  **I guess I am still struggling to reconcile what you said with what the person above you said**  Like, I am not making up or imagining the structural, institutional, violence-laden, economic, geographic, educational and informational barriers (last two being so fucking critical).  Yet as an American, people understand and accept things the electoral college, gerrymandering, citizens united, etc.  I mean those educated and open minded and compassionate understand these are real things actually making change really hard in the US.

But still, I don't know how else we could have done things differently in the real world; especially when Lebanon is a who's who of geopolitical and global meddling.

I have just accepted, for better or worse, the pro-democracy West (of which I support and am part of as a proud American) will see my Lebanese side as \""but fuck the populace\"".  It kinda sucks lol.

To give an example...  The American founders were skeptics of democracy; they held a *very* aristocratic view of liberty.  A core criticism they had of British governance was the fact that the monarchy could arbitrarily reassign lands and public authority based on crown interests.    Equal representation per state was meant to stop the new national capital from making itself a monarchy, routinely sabotaging its opponents by eliminating their franchise.  Land ownership was thought by various founders as a key element of aristocratic virtue, while citizen electoral democracy was considered dangerous.  So, the land-based franchise was most strongly protected in the governing contract they wrote.  In this way, Washington would never be able to disempower the people (effectively defined as wealthy landowners) by taking away land-based Senate representation.  The same thinking justified the geography-based Amendment process.  It's telling that the only other Art. V entrenched clauses were thirty-year protections for landowners regarding direct (land) taxes and for unlimited importation of slaves.  All the Constitution's famed Nth-Amendment civil rights, free speech, due process, guns, voting, etc. sit at a level beneath the Senatorial power guarantee.  And arguably, any rule that meaningfully diminishes Senatorial power could be thought of as violating the \""equal suffrage\"" clause.

And this isn't just some anarchist conspiracy theory, but a serious state formation theory in politicial science known as the Stationary Bandit Theory.  The story roughly goes like this:  1. At the dawn of civilisation, you have settled farmers and roaming bandits.  2. The bandits keep robbing the farmers.  3. Eventually, some groups of bandits become settled themselves. Their business model changes from 'kill the farmers and plunder everything' to 'take protection money so you have a steady stream of income'.  4. These 'stationary bandits' will then find themselves protecting an area from hostile bandits, to secure their income stream. They begin to draft troops from the farmer settlements.  5. To better secure their power, they build a basis of legitimacy. This involves law, defense, infrastructure, and the development of a shared culture. This legitimacy helps with the drafting of new troops and to prevent rebellions against the ruling power.  Thus, a state is born.  In the absence of such a state, other states will subdue stateless settlements. So the alternative is democracy: The settlements form coalitions and maintain a government to manage shared affairs (like defense, law, and infrastructure) by themselves.  A gang-controlled area is one in which no state is maintaining control, so it reverts back to the beginning of it all: Bandits fighting over who gets to extort the 'farmers' (i.e. economy). And just like the bandits at the dawn of civilisation, they may want to foster goodwill and legitimacy by providing services to people rather than purely rob them.  Terrorist groups in the middle east have long been experts at this process. Hamas, Hezbollah, Al'Qaida, Taliban, ISIS and many more spend  much effort on appearing generous (by taking control of local supply chains) and fair (by giving great reverence to the families of the fallen... at least some of them).

With dogs, when they are puppies, first their mother will teach them what level of nips and paw batting is appropriate for dogs. She will be very firm with them and clearly tell them off if they get it wrong!   This tends to be a bit rougher than humans can cope with, so when a puppy starts living with it owners, the humans must then teach it what it okay for them. Of course, dogs are domesticated so are much easier to train and more willing to obey.  Tigers can be taught to some extent as young cubs, but they still have all their wild instincts which will be driving them to try and hunt, or practice as adolescent tigers. The other problem is that if a tiger gets the play wrong with a human, eg. Nips the a hand or bats a human with a paw, due to their size and strength, it can go wrong *very* quickly.  Tigers raised to be around humans (this should be banned) are removed from their mother at a very early age, often pretty much once their eyes open. This means they miss out on early lessons about power and control from mum, who speaks the same language and can control them effectively. Instead, they are socialised with humans, in a foreign language and against instinct. The human is not durable either so if a tiger misjudges the game, the human primary caregiver may be critically injured and unable to continue socialising the tiger for a while. Meanwhile, the tiger continues developing but without a ‚Äúparent‚Äù to teach them. Another person might replace the injured one, but this won‚Äôt be seen as the ‚Äúparent‚Äù  Of course, it is cruel to breed tigers in captivity, especially non registered zoos and private owners that do not contribute to extinction protection breeding programmes (like Joe Exotic and Doc Antle).

I actually started bringing a hand shovel so I could join in - she loved that and would marinate my face in licks when we were digging together.  When my marriage broke down, she would come up with the most hilarious passive-aggressive things to do to my soon to be ex wife. Stuff like when the ex would go to sit down, the dog would quickly jump on whatever seat she'd chosen or standing across the doorway and suddenly going deaf every time my ex would try to enter a room I was in. She died two days after the divorce was finalised, almost like she wanted to make sure the kids and I were clear.  Here she is the [first time she was in the front seat](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xvy6n0gBS9o)."", ""My first dog, my mom was recently divorced, and it was just us now. I asked my mom if we could finally get a dog, and she answered, \""We'll see.\"" That was not a no, so off I went to find my dog. I went to the shelter looking for an older male German Shepherd. I found one and took it out to the yard. It ran to the far reaches of the yard and ignored me completely. I let the dog have its time and asked an employee to help me get it back in.   Feeling defeated, I just decided to stop and pet every animal in the shelter. There was this little black puppy with white paws, labeled \""black lab mix\"", she just ate up all the pets I gave her. A woman saw us and said I should take her out. I took her to the yard, and she parked herself in between my feet, never left my side. A girl scout troop was there, and their leader said, \""I think she chose you.\"" The dog them puked green vomit at my feet. An employee came over to clean it up and informed me she was very sick. I could adopt her, but I had to have a vet scheduled before I could take her home. I adopted her, she rode the whole way home with her head on my arm, staring at me.   The vet told me she had full blown pneumonia, and she was not likely to make it, even giving me those eyes as if to say theres no hope. I didn't believe him. She was so happy and energetic,  there was no way this dog was dying. They gave me antibiotics and some cream to ease her green snot ridden crusty raw nose. We went home.   Aside from developing seizures and hip ataxia, she lived an incredibly happy 14yo life(as a border collie mix herding cars on our walks, not a lab mix who hated the pool.)"", ""When I got my dachshund, he was with 4 brothers and sisters.

But when we went to the farm to go pick one out, I remember walking into a side room that seemed completely empty except for one little orange kitten sitting in the middle of the room. After a little bit all the other kittens came out of hiding, but it was too little too late because we had already made up our minds.  Fun fact, apparently female orange tabbies are rare!"", ""THEY DO WHAT?  MY DOG!"", ""I used to work at an animal shelter. We had a giant monster of a dog that was friendly but boisterous, and therefore hard to adopt out. We finally sent him home with a couple that had met our criteria, but honestly, I think we were so glad that someone would take him, we ignored some flags.  I had to pick him up and put him in the guys truck.  They brought him back a week later accusing us of having given them a vicious dog. Honestly, I don't think they treated him nicely (alpha dog nonsense), and the dog was too stubborn to be dominated.  During that week, we had been contacted by another guy who was interested in adopting that same dog. When the dog was returned we invited the guy to come meet our giant beast. We were a little more cautious judging the human this time, but the real tell.... when it came time to go home with his new human, the guy opened his truck door and the dog jumped straight in and sat on the passenger seat.  That was it. He refused to be moved (to the back seat) and would not look at me. He was going home.  The guy has brought the dog back for visits a couple of times. He describes a content dog that sleeps a lot and loves going for snowmobile runs and horse rides (trotting alongside). The dog is always happy to see us, but dammit.... he's getting back in the truck and will not be moved when its time to leave.  People say dogs \""know\"", but I never believed it.

He was happy to see me and ran from the human he was talking to, and came over to say hi to me.  Turned out that was the dogs owner.

I'd also like to point out that both of my dogs were/are purebreds (I DNA tested both) and came from breed-specific rescues, so it's very possible to adopt a certain breed if it's wanted without going through a breeder specifically.¬†My first dog was a big Papillon who'd been found as a stray and my current is a Mini Aussie who was rescued from a bad puppy mill -- both cutesy, sweet breeds that people often look to breeders for and can be harder to find in shelters.

She's the very epitome of a cat person. She already had other cats. Her house is a monument to her cat-ness.  She didn't want him, either, but she agreed to take him in for the night and find him a home in the morning. She was actually pretty mad at me for even suggesting it.

This service is where the tracking stats came from, not anything with vote.gov itself.  A quick look at the way that link works shows that the `/register` page pre-populates a number of analytics including the user's geolocation (likely just derived from your IP address), fires off a couple requests to tracking endpoints (on `lnk.to`, not vote.gov), and then finally the JavaScript redirects you to `https://vote.gov/` (no query parameters). The request sending you to vote.gov doesn't have any headers tied to Taylor's link other than the standard `Referer` header added by all browsers unless otherwise configured by the server, so it doesn't look like she was working with vote.gov themselves.  It only takes a fraction of a second for the `lnk.to` page to load, submit its analytics, and redirect you off to vote.gov so it can look like she used a custom vote.gov link to the user but it was a separate link shortener of her own.

The corporation AND the individual people are both held responsible in such cases.  The concept of \""corporate personhood\"" exists because trying to track down the individual employee who engaged in wrongdoing can be burdensome and also that person may well not even have assets that could compensate you for what they did.  This is why we treat corporations as \""people\"" - they exist as a single legal entity that can be sued, brought to court, pay taxes, own property, etc.  It's something we call a \""legal fiction\"" - where we pretend something is true because it makes the court and legal system operate a lot better.  This is why \""corporations\"" have rights - because all actions taken by corporations are taken by actual people, and those people have rights, so the \""corporation\"" has those rights as well, because being part of a group of people doesn't mean your rights go away.

Or even more likely hired to create this story to cover up something else that happened."", ""> Are you suggesting that the manhunt that we're currently seeing is an accurate representation of how every murder in NY is treated? >  > Or is this one just special because he was rich?  No, it is not representative.   This one is unusual for several reasons. It is quite rare for someone to be shot on the street in Midtown Manhattan just before 7 AM. It is quite rare for an unacquainted individual to travel across multiple states to commit a murder. It is quite rare for the police to, in some sense, \""know\"" who did it in that the individual's likeness was without a doubt captured on camera but there is no easy means of linking that to other information about him.   If you or I were murdered, it is MUCH more likely that we would be murdered by someone who is acquainted with us, who lives in the same geographic area, and who has a motive that would only be shared by a smaller number of people than something like what happened in this case. And it is unlikely that police would be able to immediately identify the murderer on surveillance footage. In cases like that, a huge manhunt isn't a very effective strategy because police may not know anything about who they are looking for. But I can think of several similar cases where a manhunt was carried out for less high-profile victims. Just a few weeks ago, I got a public notification from the local police asking for residents to stay indoors because a manhunt was on for a suspect accused of befriending a local hiker and then killing him on the trail to take his identity. That guy was recognized by a nurse at a hospital and captured.   I don't think it is hard to understand why police and the FBI would want to make a big show of searching for this particular guy. First, they need the public's help and second, they want to send a strong deterrent signal. The first point is obvious. On the second, a rash of similar crimes where unrelated people travel thousands of miles to assassinate high profile individuals who they have a problem with would obviously be a huge disruption of public safety. I'm sure that they want the message to be \""We'll do everything to find you and you won't get away,\"" so that anyone else considering this thinks twice about it."", ""They are just super upset because the response from the public about this CEO getting offed is about the same as when Ted Bundy was executed in Florida.

Now that this kind of action has been normalized by a giant media and social media circle jerk praising the attacks and lamenting the near misses, the genie is going to be hard to put back into the bottle."", ""The other issue is because of being under-resourced the government is only able to go after the big fish.  Problem with that is the big fish are harder to fry and if they do fry they wont produce much in terms of a fine. Always find a way to get out of it.  The real players, might not be for billions, are all the small town doctors running practices that should tops net 400-500K but are bringing them in 2-3M. You might say oh who cares its one doctor, every fucking doctor in America does this, and they say if you dont you are an idiot and working hard for no reason (as a doctor)  For example, here is a convo i overheard from an internist to another internist thinking about opening his own practice. \""Man all these patients that come in all get a drug test, doesnt matter what they are here for. I have a lab in my clinic, i run the tests for free, and bill Medicaid/Medicare and get at least $10-30 a test if not more if its private insurance. So now multiply 20 x 20 patients thats an extra $400. There are 100s of ways to fuck the system every day.  If you arent willing to fuck the system you work for someone or a hospital and clock in and clock out.  The number of HONEST physicians who run their own practices legally and morally is few and far between. Truthfully, from my personal experience, it's almost not worth opening your own practice unless you can leverage these types of \""side hustles\"" to boost your specific clinic's income over the same type of doctor working salary.  There was one guy who was injecting people with chemo even though they didnt need it.

He is in prison but here is the story  >A Detroit area hematologist-oncologist was sentenced today to serve 45 years in prison for his role in a health care fraud scheme that included administering medically unnecessary infusions or injections to 553 individual patients and submitting to Medicare and private insurance companies approximately $34 million in fraudulent claims.  >Assistant Attorney General Leslie R.

Even in this fucking EVIL man's case he was only made to pay back 18M. Chemo drugs are so expensive one dose can cost thousands you think he treated 500 patients and only made 34M total? Not a fat chance this guy doesnt have 80-200M (remember there are patients they dont know about records destroyed) stored away somewhere in someone else's name  Again there are doctors that do little things to subtly increase their income by 50-200K - wont be investigated and then there are reckless pieces of trash who will hurt patients or make them undergo unnecessary tests to make an extra buck.  It's pathetic but it's only going to get worse as PA/NP make more and insurance companies would rather hire PA/NP and pay them less than what they would pay a doctor forcing doctors to do shady things to make a salary to match their 12 years of schooling and training."", ""CNN spun off a whole channel just for missing white girls!""]"
